# EmulationStation

This is a fork from [Retropie's `EmulationStation`](https://github.com/RetroPie/EmulationStation).
`EmulationStation` is a cross-platform graphical front-end for emulators with controller navigation.

## Motivation

This fork is different than a standard fork in its purpose.
The main aim is to setup builds for versioned releases of Retropie's `EmulationStation`, as the [original project download page](https://emulationstation.org/) are out of date.

Currently, the only solution to get binaries for the Retropie's version is to build it by yourself.
Another option, for Window's users, is to download the continuous integration build from [@jrassa](https://github.com/jrassa/EmulationStation/releases), which is updated with the latest developmental version.

The idea of this repository is to:

* Provide build scripts for Retropie's `EmulationStation` in a repository.
  This allows other developers to contribute and adapt the build scripts for other needs.
* Keep a versioned list of artifacts on GitHub.
  This allows to install at any time old stable versions.

## Features

The following list of features to accomplish the purpose of this repository could be takes as:

* A roadmap for included features.
* A notice/acknowledgement about where the idea/source comes from.
